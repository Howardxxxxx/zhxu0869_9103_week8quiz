PART1:
Action painting was a trend in abstract art from the 1940s to the 1960s that existed within the framework of Abstract Expressionism. Jackson Pollock pioneered action painting. His representative work of ink splash painting "Number 1A" and “Enchanted Forest” uses random lines and random ink spots to convey his inner world, and also has a very strong visual impact. The random, intricate and tense lines in this painting inspired me. This line plays a big role when it comes to expressing the visual effects and vitality of the page, and it can be a very beneficial technique.
